*** Up to the Friday 22nd of June
Looked at the jTrace code
Started off alternate model
Started off own simulation viewer (comparing directly our model to the original trace)


*** Friday 29th of June
Still building the benchmark interface (lexicon editor)
Results of "locking" the schwa phoneme :
- all the words containing schwa get over-activated (even if schwa isn't in the input, as it still gets activated thanks to other vowels) 
- the silence word "-" is recognised when word not recognised, e.g. "tart" -> "-" instead of "tart" -> "bar"



TODO
simple lexicon editor (without frequency and all other additional parameters, we don't nedd them since they are not part of the core of the Trace model).
extract the provided lexicons into "simple" files, and make them easily interchangeable (i.e combo box with list of files in the lexicons/ directory)
Phonemes : extend the code to contain all possible phonemes. No editor. Phonemes actually used are the ones present in the lexicon.

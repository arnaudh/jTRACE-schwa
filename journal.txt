*** Up to Friday 22nd of June
Looked at the jTrace code
Started off alternate model
Started off own simulation viewer (comparing directly our model to the original trace)


*** Friday 29th of June
Still building the benchmark interface (lexicon editor)
Results of "locking" the schwa phoneme :
- all the words containing schwa get over-activated (even if schwa isn't in the input, as it still gets activated thanks to other vowels) 
- the silence word "-" is recognised when word not recognised, e.g. "tart" -> "-" instead of "tart" -> "bar"


*** Saturday 30th of June
Built a simple Lexicon Editor. Extracted the provided lexicons into "simple" files.

*** Sunday 1st of July
Built Schwa component, which receives activation from schwa phoneme in phonLayer.
Built a lexicon activator (schwa listener) which sends extra activation to the words containing schwa

*** Monday 2nd of July
Built Schwa graph.
Results : 
- words containing "^" get a boost in activation
- when the input contains "^", the word is recognized a bit sooner. For other inputs, the results are essentially the same. 


*** Tuesday 3rd of July
Activations of the original and modified model are now shown on the same graph, for easier comparison.


TODO
Read Van Oostendorp
Phonemes : extend the code to contain all possible phonemes. No editor. Phonemes actually used are the ones present in the lexicon.
